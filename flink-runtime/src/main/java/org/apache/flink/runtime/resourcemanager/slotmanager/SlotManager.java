/**
 * The slot manager is responsible for maintaining a view on all registered task manager slots,
 * their allocation and all pending slot requests. Whenever a new slot is registered or an allocated
 * slot is freed, then it tries to fulfill another pending slot request. Whenever there are not
 * enough slots available the slot manager will notify the resource manager about it via {@link
 * ResourceAllocator#declareResourceNeeded}.
 *
 * <p>In order to free resources and avoid resource leaks, idling task managers (task managers whose
 * slots are currently not used) and pending slot requests time out triggering their release and
 * failure, respectively.
 *
 * * SlotManager服务管理整个集 群的Slot计算资源，并对Slot计算资源进行统一的分配和管理
 * 主要用 于管理和协调整个集群的Slot计算资源，同时实现了对TaskManager信息的注册和管理* *
